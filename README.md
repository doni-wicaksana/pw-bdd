Hi, my name is Doni Wicaksana, and I am excited to present to you a framework that combines the power of Cucumber and Playwright. I hope that this framework will be helpful for you in your testing endeavors. Thank you for your time.

# why Playwright?
1. Developed by Microsoft: Playwright is a browser automation tool that is developed and maintained by Microsoft, which is a trusted and reliable technology company.
2. Code Generator: Playwright has a unique code generator feature that allows us to record our activity on a page and turn it into code. This saves us time and effort in writing the code ourselves.
3. Auto Wait: Playwright's "Auto wait" feature eliminates the need for explicit wait statements, making tests more stable and reliable. Additionally, Playwright already supports testing Shadow DOM, which is a major advantage.
4. Visual Regression Testing: Playwright can run visual regression tests to compare our screenshots with a base screenshot, making it easy to detect any unexpected changes that may have been introduced.
5. Video Recording: Playwright can also record our test runs as a video, which can be helpful for debugging and identifying issues.
6. Debugging and Tracing: Playwright has built-in debugging and tracing features, which makes it easier to diagnose issues and optimize tests.
In summary, Playwright is a comprehensive browser automation tool that offers a wide range of features and benefits, making it a great choice for any testing project.

# Why use Cucumber?
1. Cucumber is based on BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) with Gherkin syntax, which makes it easier to understand and write tests for non-technical stakeholders.
2. Cucumber provides an effective way to run tests and hide the complexity of the code, especially for manual QA.
3. It supports custom reports and allows for easy attachment of test artifacts such as screenshots or log files.
4. The scenario outline feature in Cucumber allows us to run a single test scenario with multiple sets of data, making it more efficient and reducing the need for repetitive test cases.
5. Cucumber can also run tests in parallel, which saves time and speeds up the testing process.
6. For API testing, Cucumber can replace UI-based tools like Postman with a text-based approach, making it simpler and more scalable.
7. And there are many more features that make Cucumber a powerful and flexible testing framework. So, let's get started and explore Cucumber-js!
